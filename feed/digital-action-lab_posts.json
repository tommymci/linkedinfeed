Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).\n\nThe realization is hitting hard: \n❌ Ranking #1 on Google doesn't matter if ChatGPT answers the user's question without a click. \n✅ The new battleground is ensuring your brand is \"visible\" and \"recommended\" by AI agents.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who joined the conversation. \nThe shift from \"Search\" to \"Answer\" is here, and today proved that Hong Kong's top enterprises are ready to tackle it.\n\nMissed the session? We are opening up 5 more slots for the Custom AI Visibility Audit (the same one our guests received).\n\nComment \"VISIBILITY\" below, and I’ll DM you the details.\nJames B. Lindsay Baljin S.

      "description": "The \"Zero-Click\" era is here. Is your SEO strategy fighting the wrong war?\n\nIt’s the nightmare scenario for every digital leader: You rank #1 on Google, but your traffic is flat. Why? \nBecause the user never clicked. They got their answer from an AI summary and moved on.\n\nThe data confirms the shift: \n📉 Zero-click searches are skyrocketing. \n📉 CTRs are plummeting as AI overviews take over. \n📉 80% of consumers (Bain & Co) no longer rely solely on traditional search to learn about brands.\n\nIf a potential client asks ChatGPT or Claude about your solution, do you know what it says? Is it recommending you? Or your competitor?\n\nUntil now, this was a blind spot. Not anymore.\n\nJoin us on Dec 3 for an exclusive executive luncheon with Amplitude. \nWe are unveiling the new AI Visibility framework—the first tool designed to measure your standing in the age of LLMs.\n\nExclusive for attendees: We will be generating a Custom AI Visibility Report for your brand, showing you exactly how you rank in AI-generated answers today.\n\nStop guessing. Start measuring.\n\n👉 Request your seat here (Private Dining): https://hubs.la/Q03W0Vx50\nEvent details in comment. \n\n\nhashtag\n#DigitalTransformation \nhashtag\n#AEO \nhashtag\n#AIAnalytics \nhashtag\n#Amplitude \nhashtag\n#MasterConcept \nhashtag\n#CustomerIntelligence \nhashtag\n#MarketingStrategy",

Seeing the lightbulbs go on when we demonstrated how HubSpot’s Loop Marketing solves the biggest pain point leaders face today: ⚡ Speed. ⚡ \n\n🌟 Star Speakers: \n✨ Carol Fong, HubSpot's Head of Sales, Asia, showed us why the funnel is broken and how the Loop helps you adapt in real-time. \n✨ James B. Lindsay Lindsay, Master Concept Group Concept's Director of Analytics, showed us exactly how to connect the data to make that engine run.\n\nTo everyone who joined us: Thank you for the heated discussion and the insights.\n\nTo those who couldn't make it: We are already planning the next one.
